<h1>EXOD (XMM-Newton X-ray Outburst Detector)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
EXOD is an algorithm designed for the detection of rapid X-ray transients in
photon counting data. 
</p>

<p>
The EXOD catalogue was compiled from 15,105 XMM-Newton observations spanning from 2001-08-19 to 2023-11-16.
</p>

<p>
The data on this website contains the results from the output of EXOD over 3 different time binnings:

5s, 50s, 200s and 3 different energy bands 0.2-2.0 keV (soft) 2.0 - 12.0 keV (hard) and 0.2 - 12.0 keV (full).
</p>

<p>
<b>Please note that due to the dynamic nature of the loading of data on this website, some pages my
take a while to load, please be patient.</b>
</p>
    
<p>
If you use the EXOD catalogue in your research and publish results, please
acknowledge the catalogue and cite the relevant paper:
